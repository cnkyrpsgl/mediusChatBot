# Medius Health Backend Engineering Challenge
**Language: Python version 3.7.1**  
Python Django and Django channels for web socket implementation is used for the minimal chatbot web application.  
**Aim of the Project**  
Making use of a python-based web server (preferably Django), socket communication concepts, and a database that drives the real-time chat server  
**Further Considerations**  
Asynchronous web socket consumer with user authentication can be applied for production use. Python modules like chatterbot and trained bots and/or various DOM elements can be used for handling much complexity. 
## Setup Instructions
* Firstly, Unzip bot directory
* Run the cmd / terminal and go to working directory (..\mediusChatBot)
* Install required packages for Python
* `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
* In current directory, run `python manage.py runserver`
* On the browser, open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`
